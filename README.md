Analysis of the NOAA Storm Database Health and Economic Impact of Weather Events

#Analysis of the NOAA Storm Database. Health and Economic Impact of Weather Events in the U.S.

#Synopsis
#This is the assignment for a Coursera course Reproducible Research. A quote from text of the assignment.

#“Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

#This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage."

#We explore the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) storm database and answer two questions:
  
#Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?
#Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?
#During the entire analysis following observations were there : 
  
#Tornado is the most harmful weather event in the U.S with respect to population health.

#Floods have the greatest economic consequences in the U.S.
